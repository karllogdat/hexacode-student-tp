Student TaskPro a student-focused to-do list application designed 
to help all students manage their academic responsibilities effectively. 
It enables the students to input their specific academic tasks and 
classify them by their respective deadlines. The overall central design 
of this software is prioritization, in which aims to assist the students 
to set priority to their to-do tasks while keeping emphasis on the most 
urgent or significant task first.
